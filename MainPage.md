# Introduction #

For reasons, which I will not belabor here, I did not have the opportunity to properly compile and compartmentalize the source code for each chapter of the book. In lieu of this, I am posting the digital text of the first draft of the book.

Hopefully, this will address some of the concerns posted here and give users something to work with.

This text is not edited and it will not align with the retail copy of the book, but the project code should be the same.

Ideally, each chapter would be broken into wiki pages here which anyone could edit; however, I don't have the time or resources to do this myself. Anyone who feels adventurous is welcome to do so. Email me, and I can give you admin access to the relevant pieces.
